This is my first blog website, I've created it to practise vuex and fetching data and posting to servers, I didnt care that much about the desing, I just wanted to try the tech-side of the thing. I have a lot more projects on my Porftolio, here's a link to it, https://franzhirt.vercel.app/ Thanks for reading. Franz",
